HONEI README FILE

INSTALLING
* Untar and decompress the honei archive.
* Run './configure' in the untarred honei archive's top-level directory.
* Run 'make'.
* Optionally run 'make check'.
* Run 'make install'

To adapt the honei installation to your systems features, you can give several parameters to the configure script.
A full list can be obtained with './configure --help'.
The common parameters are:
--enable-cell           Build Cell BE support
--enable-gpu            Build GPU support
--enable-cuda           Build CUDA support
--enable-sse            Build SSE support
--with-visual           Build the visual applications
--prefix=PATH           Change the installation path to PATH


BENCHMARKS
Along with the applications the benchmarks can be found in /usr/local/bin (unless you changed the installation path with --prefix=installation_path).
The benchmark names should be self-explanatory.
By adding 'i' for interactive mode or 'cuda', 'sse', 'cell' to the benchmark call, you can specify what backends should be benchmarked.
