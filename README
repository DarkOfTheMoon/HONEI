HONEI README FILE

INSTALLING
* Decompress and untar the honei archive.
* Run './configure' in the untarred honei archive's top-level directory.
* Run 'make'.
* Optionally run 'make check TYPE=quick'.
* Run 'make install'

To adapt the honei installation to your systems features, you can give several parameters to the configure script.
A full list can be obtained with './configure --help'.
The common parameters are:
--enable-cell           Build Cell BE support
--enable-gpu            Build GPU support
--enable-cuda           Build CUDA support
--enable-sse            Build SSE support
--with-visual           Build the visual applications
--prefix=PATH           Change the installation path to PATH

Currently only common versions of the GNU Compiler Collection's c++ compiler are fully supported and tested.

In order to use the SSE backend, you must at least enable SSE2 support of your compiler (CXXFLAGS+="-msse2" for g++).
To build the visual applications you need GL, GLU and GLUT headers and libraries.

The Cell backend relies heavily on the IBM Cell SDK 2.0.
Therefore the IBM Cell SDK (at least version 2.0) should be installed properly.
In addition you need an installed libspe2 and CC/CXX must point to the SDK's GNU c/c++ compilers.

APPLICATIONS
The installed applications (assuming you activated building visual applications by '--with-visual') are:
honei-poisson
honei-swe
Once started, you can get an options menu by a right-click anywhere within the application window.

BENCHMARKS
The benchmarks can be found in /benchmark in the build directory.
The benchmark names should be self-explanatory.
By adding 'i' for interactive mode or 'cuda', 'sse', 'cell' to the benchmark call, you can specify what backends should be benchmarked.


RUNTIME PARAMETERS
To tune HONEI to your systems specifications, you can configure runtime parameters, e.g. the number of SPEs used when executing Cell programs.
The easiest way to do so is to copy the file honei/honeirc from the honei tarball to your home directory under the name .honeirc.
Now you can edit ~/.honeirc and adapt all settings to your needs.
