HONEI README (clients/swe/README)
------------

RUNNING GUI APPLICATION
-----------------------
To run the SWE gui application, process the following steps (it is assumed here, that HONEI has been built properly, see
the README in the HONEI root folder for instructions):

	- If not yet built, build the application by typing 'make' in the current directory.
	- Start the application by typing './honei-swe'.

By that time, you should see a GLUT window popping up, rendering the result of the start scenario's timesteps, as soon
the computational results are available. See the following section for how to use the application.

USING GUI APPLICATION
---------------------
The application just renders the result of the implemented setups (scenarios) of the SWE application, and
additionally provides the following functionality:

	Exit program
	------------
	In order to exit the program, right-click anywhere on the window to open the context menu and select
	'Exit program'. Alternatively, you can use the ESC button.

	Switching Scenarios:
	----------------------
	In order to select a new scenario, right-click anywhere on the window to open the context-menu and select
	Scenarios -> <SCENARIO>. The problem is now beeing solved and the result is then rendered. There are currently
	two scenarios provided. For altering these or setting up new ones see the next section.

	Rendering
	---------
	Rendering options can be altered by using the context menu 'Rendering options'. Such options are:
		-Toggle fill mode:       Decides wether the primitives are shaded or not.
		-Toggle shading:         Sets shading from 'Interpolated' to 'Flat' and vice versa. Default is 'Interpolated.'
		-Toggle alpha blending:  Enables/disables alpha blending. Default is using alpha blending.
		-Toggle ground:          Enables/disables rendering of the bed topography. Default is rendering the bed.
		-Taggle water:           Enables/disables rendering of the water surface. Default is of course rendering the water
					 surface
	Restart Scenario
	----------------
	In order to restart the scenario, use the context menu item 'Restart scenario' or press F5.

SETTING UP SCENARIOS
--------------------
Set up new scenarios for the SWE solver and visualize them via the gui application, by using one of the two following ways:

	Alter existing scenario
	-----------------------
	The simplest way to compute a scenario is to change values in the associated scenario implementation in 'scenario_controller.cc.'
	Setting up new scenarios is not a trivial task in the case of this solver, due to many parameters that have to be changed properly.
	It is therefore strongly recommended to restrict such changes to changing the size of the scalar fields. This can be achieved by
	changing the values of '_dheight' and '_dwidth' in the associated 'case' block in the 'switch_scenario()' function in
	'scenario_controller.cc'.

	Create new scenario
	-------------------
	In order to keep the example scenarios, you can also add new ones by simply pasting another 'case' block into the associated 'switch'
	block in 'switch_scenario()'. To make it accessible by the gui however, you will have to provide a unique scenario id and include
	a menu entry of the form
	'glutAddMenuEntry("<Description>", <id>);' in 'honei_swe.cc' in this folder.
