HONEI README (clients/poisson/README)
------------

RUNNING GUI APPLICATION
-----------------------
To run the poisson gui application, process the following steps (it is assumed here, that HONEI has been built properly, see
the README in the HONEI root folder for instructions):

	- If not yet built, build the application by typing 'make' in the current directory.
	- Start the application by typing './honei-poisson'.

By that time, you should see a GLUT window popping up, rendering the result of the start scenario, as soon
the computational results are available. See the following section for how to use the application.

USING GUI APPLICATION
---------------------
The application just renders the result of the implemented setups (scenarios) of the poisson application, and
additionally provides the following functionality:

	Exit program
	------------
	In order to exit the program, right-click anywhere on the window to open the context menu and select
	'Exit program'. Alternatively, you can use the ESC button.

	Switching Scenarios:
	----------------------
	In order to select a new scenario, right-click anywhere on the window to open the context-menu and select
	Scenarios -> <SCENARIO>. The problem is now beeing solved and the result is then rendered. There are currently
	two scenarios provided. For altering these or setting up new ones see the next section.

	Rendering
	---------
	Rendering options can be altered by using the context menu 'Rendering options'. Such options are:
		-Toggle fill mode:       Decides wether the primitives are shaded or not.
		-Toggle shading:         Sets shading from 'Interpolated' to 'Flat' and vice versa. Default is 'Interpolated.'
		-Toggle alpha blending:  Enables/disables alpha blending. Default is using alpha blending.

	Restart Scenario
	----------------
	In order to restart the scenario, use the context menu item 'Restart scenario' or press F5.

SETTING UP SCENARIOS
--------------------
Set up new scenarios for the Poisson solver and visualize them via the gui application, by using one of the two following ways:

	Alter existing scenario
	-----------------------
	The simplest way to compute a scenario is to change values in the associated scenario implementation in 'scenario_controller.cc.'
	There are two examplary implementations available. One using the fixed- and one using the mixed precision configuration of the
	MG solver. Scenarios are separated in a 'case' block in the 'switch_scenario() function'. To simply compute the results for larger
	or smaller problem sizes, change the value of '_root_n' in the scenario you want to change (Note that this number has to be a power
	of two, added to one, i.e. 3, 9, 17, 33, 65, ...., to compute a solution for a _root_n*_root_n sized problem). You can also try other
	values for the setup variables provided by the MGInfo struct in 'honei/math/multigrid.hh'. For this, see the documentation of that file.

	Create new scenario
	-------------------
	In order to keep the example scenarios, you can also add new ones by simply pasting another 'case' block into the associated 'switch'
	block in 'switch_scenario()'. To make it accessible by the gui however, you will have to provide a unique scenario id and include
	a menu entry of the form
	'glutAddMenuEntry("<Description>", <id>);' in 'honei_poisson.cc' in this folder.
