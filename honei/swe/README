RUNNING TESTS
-------------
To run the SWE tests, process the following steps (it is assumed here, that HONEI has been built properly, see
the README in the HONEI root folder for instructions):

	- If not yet built, build the tests by typing 'make check' in the current directory.
	- Start the application by typing './<test>_TEST'. For example, to run the tests provided in
	  'relax_solver_TEST.cc' type './relax_solver_TEST'. Alternatively, you can
	  build all tests and run specific tests by using 'make check TESTS=<test>_TEST'.

ENABLE VERBOSE MODE
-------------------
You can make use of the verbose mode of the HONEI SWE solver by adding the line
	'#define SOLVER_VERBOSE'
in the '*_TEST.cc' file before any includes are processed.

SETTING UP TEST SCENARIOS
-------------------------
Set up new test scenarios for the SWE solver and run the test by changing the values in the test file or
create new testcases by adding a test to the instantiation list, usually at the end of the file. In order to
simply alter the problem size, change the initial values of 'dwidth' and 'dheight' properly. You can also change
the value for the maximum number of timesteps to be performed by changing the value of 'timesteps'.
In principle, many aspects of the scenario can be changed to receive a different configuration of the SWE solver.
Since setting up the relaxation based solver is a non-trivial task, the solver might not work or even crash if not
set up correctly. However, changing problem sizes and total number of timesteps to compute is save and
can be performed without computing any relaxation parameters.

Note that changing the parameters in mass conservation tests require an adjustment of the analytical volumes defined
within the test.

RUNNING BENCHMARKS
------------------
To run the SWE benchmarks, process the following steps:
	- If not yet built, build the benchmarks by typing 'make' in the 'honei/benchmark/' directory.
	- Start the benchmark by typing './<test>_BENCHMARK'. For example, to run the benchmarks provided in
	  'relax_solver_BENCHMARK.cc' type './relax_solver_BENCHMARK'.
See the README in 'honei/benchmark/' for further information.
