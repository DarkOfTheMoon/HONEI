SPAI Version 3.2
================

Two new execution modes have been added. They let the user specify the
structure of the approximate inverse M, rather than rely on the adaptive
procedure (mode 0, which remains the default).  They do not work for
block matrices, but only with block size 1.

In mode 1, a new parameter tau between zero and one (default zero) has the
following effect: exactly those Mij are included for which the corresponding
|Aij| > (1-tau)*max{j}|Aij|, i.e. which are larger than the maximal entry in
row i, multiplied by (1-tau).  The main diagonal is always included.  Thus
for tau = 0 (default) only the main diagonal of M will be included, whereas
for tau = 1 M will have exactly the same sparsity structure as A.

In mode 2, the user can define a band structure for M. The main diagonal is
always included; in addition, one can specify the number of diagonals below
(-ld, default 0) and above (-ud, default 0) the main diagonal.


Detailed list of changes from version 3.1 to version 3.2
========================================================

files/routines:
--------------
basics.h: #include <stdio.h> added; #include <malloc.h> removed.
          mmalloc definition added (see below).

basics.c: routine mmalloc added; is called everywhere instead of malloc.
          Prints an error message if memory allocation fails. Returns
          pointer as before (which may be NULL).

bicgstab.c:
   int bicgstab_R and int bicgstab_L return error code != 0 in case of error.
   Both routines rewritten (code is shorter and clearer).
   Convergence criterion (residual) printed every 10 steps only.

qr.c:
   int qr returns error code != 0 in case of error. The Fortran
   library routines are called directly now (with underscore).

command_line.c:
   Several new options added (see below for full list). The argument -h
   or -help (as first and only argument) prints a list of all options
   on standard output.
   Only one data statement for help printout  and default definition.

spai.h: routine definitions changed.

spai.c:
    int bspai returns error code != 0 in case of error.
    int spai returns error code != 0 in case of error.
    Externs are integrated (no file externs.h anymore).
    Several new options in argument list:
int bspai
(matrix *A, matrix **bspai_matrix,
 FILE *messages_arg,   /* file for warning messages */
 double epsilon_arg,   /* tolerance */
 int nbsteps_arg,      /* max number of accepted elements per line
                          (spar_arg = 0); is set to ld+lu+1 for spar = 2 */
 int max_arg,          /* max dimensions of I, q, etc. */
 int maxnew_arg,       /* max number of new entries per step */
 int bs,               /* block size */
 int cache_size_arg,   /* one of (1,2,3,4,5,6) indicating size of cache */
                       /* cache_size == 0 indicates no caching */
 int verbose_arg,
 int spar_arg,
 int lower_diag_arg,
 int upper_diag_arg,
 double tau_arg)

int spai
(matrix *A, matrix **spai_mat,
 FILE *messages_arg,   /* file for warning messages */
 double epsilon_arg,   /* tolerance */
 int nbsteps_arg,      /* max number of "improvement" steps per line */
 int max_arg,          /* max dimensions of I, q, etc. */
 int maxnew_arg,       /* max number of new entries per step */
 int cache_size_arg,   /* one of (1,2,3,4,5,6) indicating size of cache */
                       /* cache_size == 0 indicates no caching */
 int verbose_arg,
 int spar_arg,
 int lower_diag_arg,
 int upper_diag_arg,
 double tau_arg)

test_spai.c
-----------
 New timing added; new options read.


Full list of options:
=====================

           -sc:  sparsity control:
		 0 = adaptive,
		 1 = specified tau,
                 2 = fixed diagonals (-ud & -ld)
