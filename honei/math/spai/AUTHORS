The SPAI code was originally written by Marcus J. Grote.  It was rewritten
and parallelized by Stephen Barnard who was formerly at NASA Ames.  Oliver
Broeker added the GNU autoconf and GNU automake configuration to the
package, which was further modified and is currently maintained by Michael
Hagemann.
