HONEI README (honei/math/README)
------------

RUNNING TESTS
-------------
To run the poisson tests, process the following steps (it is assumed here, that HONEI has been built properly, see
the README in the HONEI root folder for instructions):
	- If not yet built, build the tests by typing 'make check' in the current directory.
	- Start the application by typing './<test>_TEST'. For example, to run the tests provided in
	  'poisson_mg_double_banded_TEST.cc' type './poisson_mg_double_banded_TEST'. Alternatively, you can
	  build all tests and run specific tests by using 'make check TESTS=<test>_TEST'.

ENABLE VERBOSE MODE
-------------------
You can make use of the verbose mode of the HONEI Multigrid solver by adding the line
	'#define SOLVER_VERBOSE'
in the '*_TEST.cc' file before any includes are processed. This mode prints out iteration numbers and defect-norms
and other information that could be useful.

SETTING UP TEST SCENARIOS
-------------------------
Set up new test scenarios for the Poisson solver and run the test by changing the values in the test file or
create new testcases by adding a test to the instantiation list, usually at the end of the file. In order to
simply alter the problem size, see the following instructions:

Such tests load data from a binary file and compare analytical and reference results with the computed
results. Simply substitute the filename by the one you want to test against. The files are
named '<problem size>.bin' in the 'honei/math/testcases/' directory. The test adjusts the problem size
accordingly. See the directory for available binaries.

RUNNING BENCHMARKS
------------------
To run the poisson benchmarks, process the following steps:
	- If not yet built, build the benchmarks by typing 'make' in the 'honei/benchmark/' directory.
	- Start the application by typing './<test>_BENCHMARK'. For example, to run the benchmarks provided in
	  'poisson_mg_double_banded_BENCHMARK.cc' type './poisson_mg_double_banded_BENCHMARK'.

See the README in 'honei/benchmark/' for further information.
